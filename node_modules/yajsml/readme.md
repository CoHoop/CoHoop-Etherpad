Yajsml is yet another (Common)JS module loader. It is a server-side component
that allows JavaScript code to be distributed in a reliable and performant way.
Its three features are:

 - Proxy pass through for individual resource requests.
 - Bulk responses for requests of closely associated resources (e.g.
   dependencies) when a request specifies a JSONP-style callback.
 - Canonical packaged resources where requests for disparate resources may be
   fulfilled through a redirect to one canonical packaged resource (which
   exploits warmed caches).

The toolâ€™s interface is simple enough that there is no need for a prescribed
implementation on the client-side. That said, the
[require-kernel](https://github.com/cweider/require-kernel) is a terse
implementation of a CommonJS module manager that can use all the features in
yajsml.
